#### Publishing a new version

##### Updating version number

For now, we need to change the version number manually.
In the future, we will improve this process to automatically increment these files in the deployment process.

Use the same version of the next tag.
You must increment the version number in these two files:

`package.json`
`CosmosTokens.podspec`


##### Publishing

To publish a new version of the NPM package and Cocoapods we only need to create a new Tag on this repository.
